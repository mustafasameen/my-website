Imagine software that thinks, learns, and solves problems like a human. AI agents are making this possible by redefining automation.

## What Are AI Agents?

AI agents are **autonomous software systems** that simulate human decision-making to solve tasks efficiently and intelligently. Unlike traditional programs, AI agents:

- **Perceive** the environment through sensors or tools.
- **Plan** and **Decide** by analyzing data and selecting optimal actions.
- **Learn** and **Adapt** from new information and experiences.
- **Act** autonomously with minimal human input.

## Core Characteristics of AI Agents

AI agents stand out due to the following traits:

- **Autonomy**: Operates without needing frequent instructions.
- **Goal-Oriented**: Focused on accomplishing well-defined objectives.
- **Adaptability**: Improves performance through iterative learning.
- **Proactivity and Reactivity**: Anticipates tasks while responding to real-time changes.

## Why Do We Need An AI Agent?

Modern challenges require intelligent, scalable solutions that traditional software cannot provide. AI agents address these needs by:

- **Automating Routine and Complex Tasks**: Saves time and resources.
- **Managing Large-Scale Data**: Processes data faster than humans can.
- **Customizing User Experiences**: Delivers highly personalized outputs.
- **Improving Decision Accuracy**: Reduces errors by analyzing patterns.

## Building a Goal-Oriented AI Agent

Let’s create a goal-oriented AI agent that retrieves and summarizes information from the web. This agent will:

- **Search**: Use DuckDuckGo to find relevant results.
- **Process**: Analyze and summarize the data with a language model.
- **Deliver**: Present actionable insights to the user.

I’ll use **CrewAI**, **LangChain**, and the **DuckDuckGo Search Tool** to achieve this.

### Code Implementation

Here’s a step-by-step implementation of the AI agent:

**1. Import the required libraries**

```python
import os
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, LLM, Process
from crewai_tools import tool
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

duckduckgo_search = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()
api_key = os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")
user_query = "Onurhan Demir work title and last company name"

if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("API key is missing.")
```

**2. Define the Search Tool**

The search tool allows the agent to query DuckDuckGo for web-based results.

```python
@tool('DuckDuckGoSearch')
def search_tool(search_query: str):
    """Search the web for information on a given topic"""
    return duckduckgo_search.run(search_query)
```

**3. Initialize the Language Model (LLM)**

The LLM interprets the search data and generates a summary.

```python
llm = LLM(
    model="groq/llama-3.1-8b-instant",
    api_key=api_key
)
```

**4. Define the Agent**

I use a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate human-like responses using extensive text data. In this project, the groq/llama-3.1-8b-instant model summarizes search results, improving our AI agent's accuracy.

The agent coordinates tasks and tools to achieve its goal:

```python
search_agent = Agent(
    role='Expert Researcher and Analyst',
    goal='Provide insightful summaries and generate related research topics using English sources.',
    backstory='A senior researcher proficient in detailed technical analysis.',
    tools=[perform_web_search],
    llm=llm,
    verbose=True,
)
```

**5. Set Up a Task**

A task describes what the agent needs to accomplish, including the expected output.

```python
search_task = Task(
    description=f'Search and summarize information about "{user_query}".',
    agent=search_agent,
    expected_output='A summary of the top 5 findings with actionable insights.'
)
```

**6. Execute the Task**

Finally, execute the agent with the Crew framework:

```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[search_agent],
    tasks=[search_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=True,
)

output = crew.kickoff()
print(output)
```

  This example shows a simple way to exposition what AI agents can do. I want to
  explain the concept clearly and show how easy it is to use these powerful
  technologies.

  data={{
    headers: ["Component", "Purpose", "What It Does"],
    rows: [
      [
        "Search Tool",
        "Fetch information from DuckDuckGo",
        "Queries the web for relevant data.",
      ],
      [
        "LLM",
        "Analyze and summarize results",
        "Processes search data to create meaningful outputs.",
      ],
      [
        "Agent",
        "Define behavior, tools, and goals",
        "Acts as the central decision-maker using tools and models.",
      ],
      [
        "Task",
        "Specify the job description and expectations",
        "Guides the agent in producing structured outputs.",
      ],
      [
        "Crew",
        "Orchestrate agents and tasks",
        "Manages execution and ensures all steps are completed in sequence.",
      ],
    ],
  }}
/>

### Expected Output

Using the earlier implementation, the AI agent can accomplish a task such as:

```python
user_query = "Onurhan Demir work title and last company name"
```

- **Search**: The agent queries DuckDuckGo for the most relevant results about _"Onurhan Demir work title and last company name"_.
- **Summarize**: The LLM processes the top results to create a concise and actionable summary.
- **Deliver**: Outputs the summary along with suggested research topics.

```python
